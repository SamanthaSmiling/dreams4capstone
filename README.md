# Dreams4Capstone

This project will be a comprehensive analysis of dream reports and mental health measures from cross-cultural surveys conducted in the United States and Argentina.

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between dream content, structure, and mental health indicators across two cultures. Participants provided:

- **Free-text dream reports** describing their dream experiences
- **Dream-related assessments** including nightmare frequency, dream intensity, and emotional tone
- **Standardized mental health questionnaires**:
  - Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) - Depression screening
  - Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) - Anxiety screening

## Methodology

### NLP Features
We will apply advanced NLP techniques to extract structural features from dream reports.

### Statistical Analysis
Our approach combines:

- **Traditional Statistical Methods**:
  - Regression analysis
  - Linear mixed models with random participant intercepts
- **Machine Learning Approaches**:
  - Logistic regression for clinical cutoffs
  - Supervised learning for prediction models

### Cross-Cultural Analysis
- Country-specific effects as fixed factors
- Interaction analysis between cultural background and dream features
- Holistic comparison of dream patterns across cultures
